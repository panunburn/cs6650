##How to build
Sample Usage:
javac *.java
java ServerAppRMI 1234
java ClientAppRMI localhost 1234

you can run as many clients as you want, but you need to first run the server.

for put/get/delete, simply enter following in the textbox:
put one 1
get one
delete one

The multithread version without RMI can be run by the same arguments without RMI.
e.g.
java ServerApp 1234
java ClientApp localhost 1234
